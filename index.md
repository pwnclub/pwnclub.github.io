Greetings! My name is <span class="my-name">Alexander Egorov</span>.<br><br>
I am currently a second year CS student at the University of Waterloo.<br>
I enjoy solving problems revolving around algorithms and data structures.<br>
I also have loads of fun working on projects, a few of which are listed below,
and others in the Projects section on this site,
and am always eager to learn more and pick up new skills.<br>
To the right you'll see a preview of the lastest post I have writte on my Blog.
These posts cover a wide variety of topics that I'm interested in.
