Greetings! My name is <span class="my-name">Alexander Egorov</span>.<br><br>
I am currently a second year CS student at the University of Waterloo.<br>
I enjoy solving problems revolving around algorithms and data structures.<br>
I also have loads of fun working on projects, a few of which are listed below,<br>
and others on my Github page,
and am always eager to learn more and pick up new skills.<br>
